<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	All data mining must begin
at the same point: data. Just like any “mining” procedure, you
first need a mine. However, unlike typical mining in rocks, we, or
other humans, are the creators of this data. This data comes with
specific data-set  and attribute types, and will usually be in one of
a few commonly excepted formats. Since we are the creators of our
data, any impurities, inconsistencies, or general errors that are in
are data-sets are often our fault. Sometimes directly, and sometimes
indirectly as the result of poor planning, and poor data gathering
procedures. Most of the time however, even when necessary precautions
are taken, data will be “imperfect”. The first step to data
mining is the understanding of these common imperfections, and how
they should best be handled. Data mining is all about finding
patterns, but finding different patterns require different
algorithms. Since these algorithms are not always immediately known,
it is important to first look at summary statistics. It may also be
important to look at a visual representation of the data, as it may
be easier to locate patterns in images versus tables of numbers. The
visualization, however, is often more relevant after the mining
process, to illustrate the patterns found in the data. In the
following paragraphs, I will further explain these fundamental
aspects of data, and data quality, which are the foundations of data
mining.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Data can come in many
forms, and thus there are multiple types of data-sets to handle
different types and domains of data. Three common types of data are
record, graph-based, and sequential data. In a record based data-set,
each individual data instance represents a record. For example, this
could be a record of things purchased, or a record made up of
biographical information in a human resources databases. The
prevalence of relational databases makes record data very familiar to
us. In a relational database, each row of a table could be considered
a record, and thus the data stored in such databases is often
record-based data. Another common type of data is graph-based data,
which is great for displaying data objects with structure. As Tan,
Steinbach, and Kumar point out, “If objects have structure, that
is, the objects contain sub-objects that have relationships, then
such objects are frequently represented as graphs.” (DM, 32)
Graph-based data is also relational, or at least associative, and
associations are represented as edges between nodes in the graph. For
example, a data-set of airports would want to keep track of the
distance, and time it took to fly from one airport to any other
destination in the network. These associations would be represented
as edges that were weighted according to this time and distance.
Finally, data that is captured over time is a great example of the
third type of data, sequential data. Sequential data happens in
sequence, so it is important to maintain the order of the data. For
example, time-based data may be stored in a linked list, or in a
relational database with a time stamp associated with each recorded
data instance. With this type of data, temporal correlation needs to
be taken into account. For example, if two items are really similar,
but they happened only 1 second apart, that it probably not a
meaningful clustering. Data-sets are made up of attributes, of which
there are also many types. Attributes can be nominal, ordinal, an
interval, or a ratio. Attributes explain different things, and may be
either qualitative or quantitative. They can also be discrete or
continuous. If an attribute is in the set of all real numbers, it is
continuous. If an attribute has a “finite or countably infinite set
of values” (DM, 28), it is discrete. Because of all these different
data-sets, consisting of different types of data and attributes, it
is important to know your data and pick appropriate data mining
methods and metrics.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">--Need side effects of data
types: graph and record</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	While understanding the
type of data you are working with and mining it using appropriate
methods will generate better results, the quality of your results
will always be influenced by the quality of the data you start with.
High data quality means data that is free of measurement and data
collection errors. It means data that is not missing data, does not
contain much noise, artifacts, or duplicates. It may also mean data
free or outliers, although is some cases like network intrusion
detection, outliers are actually an important part of the data. If
you are collecting data, it is very important to make concerted
efforts to maintain a high data quality. This is especially important
when collecting human-generated data. When collecting data from
humans, it is paramount to instill trust in the participants. Follett
and Holm emphasize that good data collection must “establish trust
with the respondents and indicate that this was a legitimate survey,
not a phishing expedition.” (BD, 28) If trust is not established
with the respondent, their answers will not be reliable. It is also
important to adequately persuade a respondent to participate in a
study, without being persuasive <I>during</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
the study, as that may effect responses. As Follett and Holm point
out, “You can't use persuasive techniques during the act of data
collection, but you </SPAN><I>do</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
need to persuade your respondents to participate in the first place.”
(BD, 30) A good way to make respondents want to participate in the
first place is to not ask too much of them. Steve Krug emphasizes the
importance of not making respondents have to think to much (Krug,
Don't Make Me Think), while Follet and Holm remind data collectors
not to “ask the user to do what you can do—or discover—on your
own.” (BD, 29) In other words, make surveys short and simple to
ensure that respondents will be willing to both start and finish
them.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">	Unfortunately,
however, data miners usually do not have the luxury of collecting
their own data. Furthermore, the data collected for a study is often
collected from other collection efforts that did not have the current
study in mind. Therefore, data will inevitably be imperfect, which is
what leads Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar to conclude that “Data is of
high quality if it is suitable of its intended use.” (DM, 43) There
are many ways you can massage, or fix data, to make it suitable for
your intended use. Missing data can be ignored, replaced with the
mean or median for that field, or records with missing fields can be
omitted. Duplicates can be parsed out and deleted from the set.
Different mining techniques and algorithms are more or less
susceptible to noise and artifacts, so if your data is rife with
these, close attention must be paid to the selection of an algorithm.
As is usually the case in data mining, the selection of algorithms
and pruning techniques to make data suitable for it's intended use
will require knowledge of the data, the problems with it's quality,
and often knowledge of it's domain.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">	Since
knowing your data is so important in order to set up your mining
operation, it is essential to explore the data before mining it.
Exploring the data could be as simple as looking over the Excel
spreadsheet or CSV file it came in, however such a simple approach is
only practical with small data-sets. With larger data-sets, it is
important to extract summary statistics from the data. These include
minimum and maximum values, mean value, median value, standard
deviation, variance, and the sum of values for each field in your
data-set. Most widely available data mining tools, such as Weka or
Knime, have this functionality built in and make it easy to explore
your data.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">---Screen

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">	If
your data-set is large, however, looking at a bunch of numbers may
not be helpful in deciphering patterns. The human eye is much more
used to finding visual patterns in images, which is why
visualization, both in the exploration stage, and in the display of
results, is another very important aspect to data-mining. Data is
often easily represented in a graph, such as the summary statistics
shown above in the screenshot from Weka. This is a good example of
using data visualization in the exploration phase. Data can be
represented in many other ways besides graphs, and a good
visualization can often demonstrate a pattern found in data much
faster than words. For example, look at the image below I generated
from a Java-based data visualization tool called Processing. This
image took input data from 225 people submitting random numbers in
response to a twitter post. By laying out the numbers in a grid, and
coloring them based on their frequency, a few patterns become
immediately apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">---Processing

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">	Look
at the column of numbers containing a 7 in the ones place. From this
pattern, one could guess that the top 10 “random” numbers between
1 and 99 that people tend to “generate” all have a 7 in the ones
place. Perhaps its the effect of the probability of getting 7 with a
pair of 6 sided dice, but there is clearly some subconscious
preference for the number 7. This pattern is immediately noticeable
when displayed in this manner, while it may have been missed in a
table of numbers, or slightly less noticeable in a bar graph.
Furthermore, this visualization can be understood just as easy by a
layperson as by the data miner. This highlights the importance of
data visualization. Visualization makes patterns discovered through
data mining easier to discover and understand for people of all
technical and mathematical backgrounds.</SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">	I
hope this exposition shined some light on the many interesting
factors that go into successfully mining data for interesting
patterns. There are many types of data, and data-sets will include
different attributes. Understanding your data, it's domain, and
composition of the data-set is essential for picking appropriate
data-mining techniques. Data quality is often the most important
factor to determining accurate and useful results. Sometimes we get
to collect our own data, and in those cases we should follow certain
guidelines to assure accurate and complete data collection,
particularly when gathering human-generated data. Unfortunately, we
don't always get the luxury of personally collecting the data we wish
to mine. In these cases, it is important to prune and massage the
data to assure accurate results. Just like picking the right
data-mining techniques and algorithms, pruning again requires
knowledge of the data-set to understand which techniques will work
best. Successful data mining mandates a good understanding of the
data-set, which is why every mining operation should begin with an
exploration of the data. In conclusion, high quality and properly
understood data is the foundation upon which all successful data
mining stands.</SPAN></P>
